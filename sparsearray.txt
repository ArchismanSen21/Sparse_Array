To optimize the program we use a HashMap to pre proscess the array before comparing it to the querie.


if(map.containsKey(input))
    map.put(input,map.get(input)+1);
else
    map.put(input,1);

Here we use the hash map to check if the array elements are in the hash map or not.
If it is there then we simply increase its frequency and if it is not present then we say put a frequency od 1.


if(map.containsKey(input_q))
    result[i]= map.get(input_q);

Here we check the hashmap with the queries if the condition is true then we put the frequency of the found elements in result array.
So, if in querie has an element which is not present in the array then it put 0 in the result array.

Time complexity of the program:
->O(length of array)+O(length of querie) :: here let's take n as length of array and m as length of querie.
->O(n)+O(m)
->O(n+m).
